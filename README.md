A little terminal "canvas" drawing tool. Still a WIP!

## Try it out!

Quickest way to get started is to just clone the repo:

```sh
git clone <this repo>
cargo build --release --examples # this is a tiny library, may as well be high-perf
./target/release/examples/lots-of-shapes # or whatever other example you like!
```
